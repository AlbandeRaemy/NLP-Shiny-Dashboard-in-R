# Shiny-Dashboard-in-R

We used Otter.ai to record an transcribe interviews of over 30 students in order to better understand what type of people are more likely to buy an electric car.

CASE:
For this assignment, your team will use the data collected during the NLP simulation (for the survey that your team designed). Your team will need to design a Shiny application that shows some business insight from the collected data (use this Shiny app in your video presentation).
